The `TimeWrapper` *interface* implemented by link:timespan.adoc[`Timespan`] and link:timestamp.adoc[`Timestamp`] (possibly more to come), started more as a convenience than actually any real requirement. Soon after implementing this interface the usage of the `Datetime` classes increased, thanks to the greater interoperability they had acquired. This in turn resulted in them quickly evolving from the skinny classes they were to what they are now, skinny but with some meat on them. Enough rambling and there's nothing left to say about it anyway.

== Defined Methods

Thus far the *interface* defines to methods:

. getSeconds
. format

=== getSeconds: int

At the core it's all numbers and for these numbers it's the seconds returned by this method.

.method: getSeconds
[source,php]
----
public function getSeconds(): int;
----

***

=== format: string

The method uses the same formatting pattern as `date` and `DateTime` as well as numerous other functions and classes in php to return a string representation of the object.

.method: format
[source,php]
----
public function format(string $format = ''): string;
----

***

=== absoluteCopy: TimeWrapper

Get a copy of the object with an absolute value.

.method: absoluteCopy
[source,php]
----
public function absoluteCopy(): TimeWrapper;
----

== Format

A subset of format options commonly used by `Datetime` classes.
