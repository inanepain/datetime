The `Timestamp` *class* is a truly simple wrapper for an *epoch timestamp*. It's mainly useful when used in combination with a link:timespan.adoc[`Timespan`] to do chained date calculations and then displaying the formatted result. Essentially it saves typing a few lines of code here and there and I think it looks a tad neater too. Nuff said, here comes it's breakdown.

== Examples

The value for `NOW` in the examples is taken to be `1660896907`.

.example 1: basic usage
[source,php]
----
// Create Timestamp with default value NOW (1660896907)
$t1 = new \Inane\Datetime\Timestamp();
echo 'TS 1: ', $t1;                                      // TS 1: 2022-08-19 10:15:07
----

.example 2: format
[source,php]
----
// Create another in the past
$t2 = new \Inane\Datetime\Timestamp(236988000);
echo 'TS 2: ', $t2->format('g:ia \o\n l jS F Y');     // TS 2: 12:00am on Wednesday 6th July 1977
----

Using the variables from example *1* and *2* to get a `Timespan`.

.example 3: timespan
[source,php]
----
// What's the timespan between them?
echo 'Time between: ', $t1->diff($t2);               // Time between: - 45yrs 1month 2weeks 1hr 52mins 1sec

$between = $t1->diff($t2);
echo $between->format('Formatted time between: %r%y years and %m months');
----

That how easy it is to use.
