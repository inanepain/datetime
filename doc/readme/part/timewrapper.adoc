The `((TimeWrapper))` *((interface))* implemented by link:timespan.adoc[`Timespan`] and link:timestamp.adoc[`Timestamp`] (possibly more to come), started more as a convenience than actually any real requirement. Soon after implementing this interface the usage of the `((Datetime))` classes increased, thanks to the greater interoperability they had acquired. This in turn resulted in them quickly evolving from the skinny classes they were to what they are now, skinny but with some meat on them. Enough rambling and there's nothing left to say about it anyway.

== Interface Methods

// tag::interfaceMethods[]

There are _three_ *interface* methods shared by `((Datetime))`` classes:

.(((method, interface)))interface methods
* (((TimeWrapper, getSeconds)))public function getSeconds(): int
* (((TimeWrapper, format)))public function format(string $format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s'): string
* (((TimeWrapper, absoluteCopy)))public function absoluteCopy(): Timestamp

// end::interfaceMethods[]

=== getSeconds: int

At the core it's all numbers and for these numbers it's the seconds returned by this method.

.method: getSeconds
[source,php]
----
public function getSeconds(): int;
----

'''

=== format: string

Used to get the object as a string using a custom format pattern. The actual implementations may use different format options best suited to the type of data they contain. Where possible patterns mimic existing php patterns.

* `Timestamp`: `\DateTimeInterface::format()`
* `Timespan`: `\DateTimeInterface::format()`

The method uses the same formatting pattern as `date` and `DateTime`, as well as numerous other php functions, to return a string representation of the object.

.method: format
[source,php]
----
public function format(string $format = ''): string;
----

'''

=== absoluteCopy: TimeWrapper

Get a copy of the object with an absolute value.

.method: absoluteCopy
[source,php]
----
public function absoluteCopy(): ((TimeWrapper));
